# React All Hooks Tuts @RoadsideCoderYT

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Roadmap for ReactJS Interview Prep

0. Check out [FrontendGeek](https://frontendgeek.com/)

1. Complete the hooks by going through React Hooks Tuts repo, referred from Roadside Coder YT.

2. Watch Render playlist from ReactJS Codevolution YT.

3. Watch top 12 react interview questions by [Akshay Saini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE925hp9KDk&t=2750s)

4. Higher Order Components (What, Why, When, How)

5. Redux/Zustand

6. Data Sharing between components, and try to answer how to share data between two sibling components?
    Ans:- States Uplifting, ContextAPI and ForwardRef the states(clean and secure method).

7. Life Cycle Methods

8. Lazy loading:- Code Splitting, Chunking, Suspense

9. Virtual DOM (learn in depth, learn what exactly happens in between virutal DOM & DOM) along with reconciliation algorithm and how the component renders? Also check out Diffing algorithm, React Fiber algorithm

10. SSR vs CSR, learn basic of NextJS. How SSR helps in SEO performance?

11. Routing RBAC (Role Based Access Control) and how to handle ProtectedRoutes? Also check out dynamic routing.

12. Testing (Keep an eye on it)

13. Performance (Lazy Loading, Asset Optimization, JS/CSS Optimization, Bundler Optimization, CDN Server Level Optimization, Aynchronous Programming, Best Rendering)

14. Styling - Tailwind, Bootstrap, MaterialUI, CSS/SCSS/Inline Styling; Learn the diff. and the benefits of one over another

15. Accessibility and Security.

16. Frontend System Design by [Shivam Bhalla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEzu4FD25KM&t=1s)
